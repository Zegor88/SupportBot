Write a detailed Technical Specification (ТЗ) document for the development task "<Insert Task Description Here>" referenced in "<Insert Epic Document Here>".

Include all necessary UML diagrams (Mermaid notation) and Use Cases.

# Steps

1. **Task Description**: Clearly define the development task that needs to be addressed.
2. **Background & Context**: Provide context from the Epic document that mentions the task. This should include any relevant background information.
3. **Objectives**: Clearly state the goals of this development task.
4. **Requirements**: Outline the technical and functional requirements for the task. Include any assumptions or constraints.
5. **UML Diagrams**: Provide appropriate UML diagrams to visually represent system interactions and workflow. Common diagrams may include:
   - Use Case Diagrams
   - Sequence Diagrams
   - Class Diagrams
6. **Use Cases**: Detail the use cases, including actors, preconditions, main success scenarios, and postconditions.
7. **Validation & Verification**: Outline how the work will be validated and verified against requirements.
8. **Dependencies**: List any dependencies or related tasks.
9. **Risks & Mitigations**: Identify potential risks and propose mitigation strategies.

# Output Format

The Technical Specification document should be formatted using Markdown. Include headings for each section mentioned in the steps, and ensure that UML diagrams are included as images or links to external files.
